Welcome to the unity face of the ImagineQuest Platform. 

To get things setup, you'll need to have unity installed, the git-repo cloned and connect the repo to your unity project.

# Unity Installation:

Go to https://unity.com/download to install unity. It's a very simply wizard. 

Create an account or sign-in.

Unity-Hub should be installed and connected to your account.

# Git-Repo Clone

Go to https://github.com/ImagineQuest/Unity click < code > (the green button) then open with Github-desktop. 

If you don't have github desktop, I recommend getting it ;)

Save the repo in an accessible location. 

# Connect Git with Unity

Open Unity-Hub (make sure you're signed-n)

Click projects

Click "Add", then "Add project from disk"

Find the imported folder from GitHub and open the folder that contains the .gitignore, .vscode, Assets, etc...

Install the project's version of Unity to avoid any errors.

You now have the project installed. Happy coding!
